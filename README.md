####golang like channels for java

Lois is a Java library that provides golang like channel abstraction and implementation.
Go's channel abstraction is heavily influenced by Communicating Sequential Processes(CSP) and
Process calculus. The pivotal idea behind concurrent process communicating over channels is

**"Don't communicate by sharing state, share state by communicating"**

Lois brings the power and flexibility of this concurrent computational paradigm to Java.
